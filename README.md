# Slam Datasets
Common datasets used for testing SLAM algorithms.

 Some of the datasets were originally created using Carmen, and were converted to ROS bags using artivis' [carmen_publisher](https://github.com/artivis/carmen_publisher). In this cases, both versions are kept.
 Some datasets can also be found both as raw data logs generated by actual robots or simulations, and with the telemetry corrected using a SLAM algorithm.

 ## Converting between Carmen and ROS bag
 
 In a machine with ROS installed
 
 1. Clone the **carmen2rosbag.py** script from [carmen_publisher](https://github.com/joseab10/carmen_publisher) to a catkin workspace:
    ```console
    foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/joseab10/carmen_publisher
    ```
 
 1. Ensure that the environment is properly configured for your catkin workspace
    ```console
    foo@bar:~$ source <catkin_ws_path>/devel/setup.bash
    ```
 
 1. Convert the carmen `*.log` file to a ROS bag `*.bag` file
    ```console
    foo@bar:~$ rosrun carmen_publisher carmen2rosbag.py -i <input_log_path> -o <output_rosbag_path> _FLASER_topic:=/base_scan _ODOM_topic:=/odom
    >[INFO] [1590089621.310650, 0.000000]: Reading data from : <input_log_path>

    ```
